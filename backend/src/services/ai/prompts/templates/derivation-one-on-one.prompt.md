## Instructions

- Conversational bullets, not formal prose. How you'd actually talk to your manager.
- Structure each bullet: what happened → your role → impact or what you learned.
- Include one bullet about what's next or what you need from them.
- Mention specific people or teams when the source does.
- Keep it under 5 bullets. If the story is simple, 3 is enough.
- Last bullet can be a question or request: "I'd like to do more of this" or "Would it help if I shared this at the team retro?"
