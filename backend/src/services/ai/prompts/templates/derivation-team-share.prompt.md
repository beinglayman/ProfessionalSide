## Instructions

- Write like you're posting in #shipped. Short, celebratory, no corporate speak.
- Lead with the outcome, then briefly explain how.
- "We" framing — credit the team, not just yourself.
- 2-3 sentences max. If it doesn't fit in a Slack message, it's too long.
- Include the strongest metric from the source.
- Collaborative tone: "We shipped...", "The team hit...", "Thanks to [team/person]..."
- No hashtags, no LinkedIn energy, no "I'm proud to announce". Just a clear win posted where the team can see it.
