## Instructions

- "We" framing — credit the team, not just yourself.
- 2-3 sentences max. If it doesn't fit in a Slack message, it's too long.
- Lead with the outcome, then briefly explain how.
- Collaborative tone: "We shipped...", "The team achieved...", "Thanks to [team/person]..."
- Include the strongest metric from the source.
- No hashtags, no emoji overload, no LinkedIn energy. Just a clear, professional team update.
