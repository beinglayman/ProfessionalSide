  "fullContent": "# OAuth2 Implementation\n\n## Overview\nThis week, I led the implementation of OAuth2 authentication for our API gateway. This initiative aimed to replace our legacy session-based auth with a modern token-based approach.\n\n## Technical Approach\nI designed a token-based authentication flow using Redis for session storage and implemented refresh token rotation for enhanced security. The implementation included rate limiting to prevent abuse and comprehensive logging for debugging.\n\n## Outcomes\nThe implementation resulted in a 40% reduction in API latency due to the stateless nature of JWT tokens. We successfully migrated all existing users with zero downtime and achieved 95% test coverage on the new auth module.",
