## Instructions

- Structure: what you did → evidence → impact. Every sentence earns its place.
- One paragraph, 4-6 sentences.
- Anti-hedging: "contributed to" → "built/shipped/led". "Helped with" → what you actually did. "Was involved in" → your specific role.
- Evidence-backed: every claim has a metric or observable outcome from the source.
- Align language to common performance competencies: impact, leadership, technical excellence, collaboration, growth.
- Professional but not stiff. Written for someone who knows the work but needs the summary.
- End with forward-looking growth: what this experience positions you for next.
