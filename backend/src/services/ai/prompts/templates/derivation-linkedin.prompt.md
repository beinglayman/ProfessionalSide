## Instructions

- First line is the hook — a number, a surprising fact, or a question. This line shows before "...see more". No "I'm excited to share" or "Thrilled to announce".
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences each). White space matters on LinkedIn.
- End with an insight or reflection, not a call to action. No "What do you think?" or "Drop a comment below".
- Add 3-5 relevant hashtags on the last line.
- Tone: confident but not boastful. Share the learning, not just the win.
- No emoji spam. One or two if they add meaning, zero is fine.
- Hard limit: 1300 characters total.
