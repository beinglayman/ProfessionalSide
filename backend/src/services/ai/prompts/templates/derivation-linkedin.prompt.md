## Instructions

- Hook in the first line — a number, a question, or a surprising fact. This line shows before "...see more".
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences each). White space matters on LinkedIn.
- End with a call to action or reflection question for the reader.
- Add 3-5 relevant hashtags on the last line.
- Tone: confident but not boastful. Share the learning, not just the win.
- No emoji spam. One or two if they add meaning, zero is fine.
- Hard limit: 1300 characters total.
