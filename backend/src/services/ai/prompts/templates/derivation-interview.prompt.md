## Instructions

- Confident and specific. No hedging ("I think", "sort of").
- Include time markers when the source provides them ("In Q3...", "Over 6 weeks...").
- Front-load the strongest number or outcome.
- Structure: brief context → what you did → measurable result.
- End with a takeaway sentence the interviewer will remember.
- Natural spoken cadence — not bullet points, not an essay.
