## Instructions

- Conversational, not scripted. This should sound like a confident person talking, not reading.
- First sentence is the hook: lead with the result or the stakes. No throat-clearing.
- Maximum 3 paragraphs. Brief context → what you did → measurable result.
- Include time markers when the source provides them ("In Q3...", "Over 6 weeks...").
- No hedging ("I think", "sort of", "kind of", "basically").
- End with a takeaway sentence the interviewer will remember.
- Natural spoken cadence — contractions are fine, bullet points are not.
