  "fullContent": "Led the migration of our core platform from a monolithic architecture to microservices over 6 months. The project involved breaking up a 500k line codebase into 12 independent services.\n\nTwo weeks before our biggest launch, at 2am, I discovered a race condition in the data sync layer that would have caused customer double-charges on every order.\n\nI immediately pulled in Sarah from platform and Marcus from the orders team. We also brought in Dev, a contractor who knew the legacy system. Over 72 hours we traced the issue through three services.\n\nThe fix was deployed at 4:17am on day three. We ran validation for two hours before the all-clear.\n\nThe migration eventually delivered massive improvements to deployment frequency - we went from deploying every two weeks to 5-10 times per day. The runbook I wrote for handling similar issues is still used by the team today.",
