    {
      "questionId": "de-dig-1",
      "question": "What was the mystery? What couldn't anyone explain?",
      "answer": "Alex Chen, our senior DBA, helped me identify the problematic queries. He had custom profiling scripts that revealed the N+1 query problem - each dashboard widget was making separate database calls instead of batching them.",

    {
      "questionId": "de-dig-1-followup",
      "question": "What was the moment you realized how big of a problem the N+1 queries were?",
      "answer": "It was the 30-day deadline that made this urgent. Our biggest customer Acme Corp had complained directly to our VP during a quarterly business review, threatening to cancel their 200K dollar annual contract.",

      "questionId": "de-dig-1-followup",
      "question": "What exactly did the VP say to you after hearing Acme Corp's threat?",
      "answer": "The mystery was why only certain users experienced the slowdown. It turned out to be data volume - power users with lots of data triggered the worst N+1 patterns.",

    {
      "questionId": "de-dig-1-followup",
      "question": "What did the VP say to you when Acme Corp made that threat?",
      "answer": "We reduced load time from 8 seconds to 1.2 seconds - an 85 percent improvement. Database CPU dropped from 78 percent to 23 percent.",

      "question": "What was the conversation like when you shared these results with the VP?",
      "answer": "The 200K Acme Corp contract was saved and they expanded usage by 40 percent. Support tickets dropped 92 percent, freeing 15 hours per week.",

      "questionId": "de-dig-1-followup",
      "question": "What was the VP's reaction specifically when you shared the CPU drop and load time improvement?",
      "answer": "I learned that premature optimization is real. Alex taught me to profile first. Just 3 queries caused 80 percent of the slowdown.",

      "questionId": "de-dig-2",
      "question": "Walk me through your investigation. What did you try first?",
      "answer": "Yes, measure before optimizing. Set up monitoring first so you have a baseline and can prove improvements with data.",

    {
      "questionId": "de-dig-3",
      "question": "What was the breakthrough moment? What led you to the answer?",
      "answer": "The breakthrough was batching the widget queries into a single database round-trip instead of N separate calls.",

    {
      "questionId": "de-impact-1",
      "question": "What was the actual root cause? How surprising was it?",
      "answer": "First I tried adding database indexes, which helped a little but not enough. Then I looked at caching but that added complexity.",

      "question": "How many people were affected before you solved it?",
      "answer": "The dead end was when I tried to cache everything - it actually made things worse due to cache invalidation issues.",
