  "hook": "Two weeks before a major launch, I uncovered a critical race condition that demanded immediate resolution to avoid customer-impacting issues.",
  "framework": "SOAR",
  "sections": {
    "situation": {
      "summary": "Our core platform was built on a monolithic architecture with a 500,000-line codebase that hindered agility and scalability. To meet growing demands and improve deployment frequency, I led a 6-month initiative to break it into 12 independent microservices.",
      "evidence": [
        "500,000 lines of code",
        "12 new independent services",
        "6-month timeline"
      ]
    },
    "obstacles": {
      "summary": "Two weeks before our biggest product launch, I discovered a race condition in the data synchronization layer at 2am that posed a risk of double-charging customers for every order. The issue was complex and spanned multiple services, requiring immediate action and cross-team collaboration under intense time pressure.",
      "evidence": [
        "Race condition in data sync layer",
        "Potential customer double-charges",
        "Critical issue discovered at 2am, two weeks before launch"
      ]
    },
    "actions": {
      "summary": "I quickly assembled a response team that included Sarah from platform, Marcus from orders, and Dev, a contractor familiar with the legacy system. Over 72 hours, we traced the issue across three services and deployed a fix at 4:17am on day three. I also documented the process in a runbook to ensure future issues could be handled efficiently.",
      "evidence": [
        "Team of 3 experts plus contractor assembled",
        "Issue traced across 3 services",
        "Fix deployed at 4:17am after 72 hours of work",
        "Runbook still in use 18 months later"
      ]
    },
    "results": {
      "summary": "The migration resulted in a dramatic improvement in deployment frequency, going from bi-weekly to 5-10 times daily. Despite the scale and complexity of the project, we achieved zero customer-facing incidents during the migration. The runbook I created continues to serve as a valuable resource for the team.",
      "evidence": [
        "Deployment frequency improved from bi-weekly to 5-10x daily",
        "Zero customer-facing incidents during migration",
        "Runbook still used 18 months later"
      ]
    }

  "reasoning": "The story was structured using the SOAR framework to highlight the scale and complexity of the project, the critical challenge faced, the decisive actions taken under pressure, and the measurable outcomes achieved. Each section underscores my leadership, technical expertise, and focus on collaboration and documentation for sustained impact.",
