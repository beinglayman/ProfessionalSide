# InChronicle - QA Testing Guide

## Overview
InChronicle is a professional journaling and career development platform that helps professionals track their growth through structured journaling, networking, and goal management. This guide provides comprehensive QA testing strategies, test cases, and quality assurance procedures.

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS + Radix UI
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Azure Flexible Server)
- **Deployment**: Azure (Web Apps with Container Registry)
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query

### Key Components
- **Onboarding System**: Multi-step professional profile setup. The aim for this section is to help the user fill in their information step by step without overwhelming them
- **Journal System**: Rich text journaling with AI-powered generation. The aim is to encourage user to share their data. This is the most important part of the system as without constant stream of user data input this platform won't be of much help
- **Network System**: Professional connections and workspace collaboration. This is where the users will be able to find and connect with other users. Inchronicle aims to keep this network very real and engaging. Hence, it limits a user to add only 100 connections as core network and 200 connections as extended network.
- **Goals System**: SMART goals with progress tracking. RACI matrix for ownership, responsibility, notifications tracking. 
- **Skills System**: Dynamic skill mapping and endorsements extracted from journal entries to build profile over time.
- **Workspace System**: Workspaces help users to securely manage details of work, goals, and artifacts. This allows professionals to manage and track their work, while allowing leader to track work and drive performance management

    const prioritized = prioritizeActivities(workspaceEntries, 'workspace');
    expect(prioritized[0].author.connectionType).toBe('core_connection');
  });
  
  it('should sort discovery entries by skill relevance', () => {
    const networkEntries = getMockNetworkEntries();

SELECT 
  je.id,
  je.title,
  u.name as author_name,
  nc.connectionType,
  je.visibility,
  je.createdAt
FROM journal_entries je
JOIN users u ON je.authorId = u.id
LEFT JOIN network_connections nc ON nc.senderId = u.id OR nc.receiverId = u.id
WHERE je.visibility = 'network'
ORDER BY 
  CASE nc.connectionType 
    WHEN 'core' THEN 1
    WHEN 'extended' THEN 2
    ELSE 3
  END,
  je.createdAt DESC;
```

#### Network Capacity Logic Testing
```javascript
// Test network capacity enforcement
const testNetworkCapacityEnforcement = async () => {
  const user = await createTestUser();
  
  // Fill core network to capacity
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    await addCoreConnection(user.id, `connection-${i}`);
  }
  
  // Attempt to add 101st connection should fail
  await expect(addCoreConnection(user.id, 'overflow-connection'))
    .rejects.toThrow('Core network capacity exceeded');
    
  // Verify warning at 80% capacity
  const userWith80Connections = await createUserWithConnections(80);
  const warnings = await getNetworkWarnings(userWith80Connections.id);
  expect(warnings).toContainEqual(expect.objectContaining({
    type: 'capacity-warning',
    severity: 'medium'
  }));
};
```

#### Content Sanitization Testing
```javascript
// Comprehensive content sanitization test
const testContentSanitization = () => {
  const sensitiveEntry = {
    title: "Project Alpha Success",
    fullContent: "Successfully delivered Project Alpha for Confidential Corp, achieving $2.3M cost savings. Internal team collaborated with Client Team Lead John Smith (john@confidential.com) to implement proprietary algorithm XYZ-2024.",
    skills: ['React', 'Node.js', 'PostgreSQL'],
    artifacts: [
      { name: 'confidential-design.pdf', type: 'document', isConfidential: true },
      { name: 'public-architecture.md', type: 'document', isConfidential: false }
    ]
  };
  
  const networkView = sanitizeForNetworkView(sensitiveEntry);
  
  // Should remove specific client information
  expect(networkView.abstractContent).not.toContain('Confidential Corp');
  expect(networkView.abstractContent).not.toContain('john@confidential.com');
  expect(networkView.abstractContent).not.toContain('$2.3M');
  expect(networkView.abstractContent).not.toContain('XYZ-2024');
  
  // Should preserve professional value
  expect(networkView.abstractContent).toContain('major enterprise client');
  expect(networkView.abstractContent).toContain('significant cost savings');
  expect(networkView.skills).toEqual(['React', 'Node.js', 'PostgreSQL']);
  
  // Should filter confidential artifacts
  expect(networkView.artifacts).toHaveLength(1);
  expect(networkView.artifacts[0].name).toBe('public-architecture.md');
};
```

### Performance & Scalability Testing

#### Feed Performance Testing
```javascript
// Test feed loading performance with large datasets
const testFeedPerformance = async () => {
  // Create test user with large network
  const user = await createUserWithLargeNetwork({
    coreConnections: 100,
    extendedConnections: 200,
    entriesPerUser: 50
  });
  
  const startTime = Date.now();
  const feed = await loadActivityFeed(user.id, { page: 1, limit: 20 });
  const loadTime = Date.now() - startTime;
  
  // Feed should load within performance budget
  expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(500); // 500ms threshold
  expect(feed.entries).toHaveLength(20);
  
  // Test pagination performance
  const page2StartTime = Date.now();
  const page2 = await loadActivityFeed(user.id, { page: 2, limit: 20 });
  const page2LoadTime = Date.now() - page2StartTime;
  
  expect(page2LoadTime).toBeLessThan(300); // Subsequent pages should be faster
};
```

#### Database Query Performance
```sql
-- Performance test queries for common operations

-- Test network connection query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT DISTINCT u.*, 
  nc.connectionType,
  nc.lastInteractionAt,
  COUNT(je.id) as recent_entries
FROM users u
JOIN network_connections nc ON (nc.senderId = u.id OR nc.receiverId = u.id)
LEFT JOIN journal_entries je ON je.authorId = u.id 
  AND je.createdAt >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
WHERE nc.senderId = $1 OR nc.receiverId = $1
GROUP BY u.id, nc.connectionType, nc.lastInteractionAt
ORDER BY nc.connectionType, nc.lastInteractionAt DESC;

-- Test feed query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT je.*, u.name, u.avatar, nc.connectionType
FROM journal_entries je
JOIN users u ON je.authorId = u.id
LEFT JOIN network_connections nc ON 
  (nc.senderId = u.id AND nc.receiverId = $1) OR 
  (nc.receiverId = u.id AND nc.senderId = $1)
WHERE je.visibility = 'network'
  AND je.createdAt >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY 
  CASE nc.connectionType 
    WHEN 'core' THEN 1 
    WHEN 'extended' THEN 2 
    ELSE 3 
  END,
  je.createdAt DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Data Integrity & Edge Cases

#### Edge Case Testing Scenarios
```javascript
const testEdgeCases = () => {
  describe('Network Management Edge Cases', () => {
    it('should handle simultaneous connection requests', async () => {
      const [user1, user2] = await createTestUsers(2);
      
      // Both users send connection requests simultaneously
      const promises = [
        sendConnectionRequest(user1.id, user2.id),
        sendConnectionRequest(user2.id, user1.id)
      ];
      
      await Promise.all(promises);
      
      // Should result in mutual connection, not duplicate requests
      const connections = await getConnections(user1.id);
      expect(connections).toHaveLength(1);
      expect(connections[0].status).toBe('accepted');
    });
    
    it('should handle network at exact capacity limits', async () => {
      const user = await createUserWithConnections(100); // Exactly at core limit
      
      // Should be able to move extended to core if core connection is removed
      const extendedConnection = await addExtendedConnection(user.id, 'ext-1');
      const coreConnections = await getCoreConnections(user.id);
      
      await removeConnection(user.id, coreConnections[0].id);
      await moveToCore(user.id, extendedConnection.id);
      
      const newCoreConnections = await getCoreConnections(user.id);
      expect(newCoreConnections).toHaveLength(100);
    });
  });
  
  describe('Feed Content Edge Cases', () => {
    it('should handle entries with no skills or empty content', async () => {
      const entry = await createJournalEntry({
        title: 'Test Entry',
        content: '',
        skills: [],
        author: testUser
      });
      
      const feed = await getActivityFeed(otherUser.id);
      const foundEntry = feed.find(item => item.id === entry.id);
      
      expect(foundEntry).toBeDefined();
      expect(foundEntry.skills).toEqual([]);
    });
    
    it('should handle very long content in network sanitization', async () => {
      const longContent = 'A'.repeat(10000) + ' Client Name Corp ' + 'B'.repeat(10000);
      const entry = await createJournalEntry({ content: longContent });
      
      const networkView = sanitizeForNetworkView(entry);
      expect(networkView.abstractContent).not.toContain('Client Name Corp');
      expect(networkView.abstractContent.length).toBeLessThan(longContent.length);
    });
  });
};
```

## QA Best Practices

### Testing Principles
1. **Test Early and Often**: Implement testing throughout development
2. **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus on high-risk, high-impact areas like network logic and content sanitization
3. **User-Centric Approach**: Test from user perspective across different connection types
4. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Use metrics to guide testing efforts
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and update testing strategies
6. **Business Logic Focus**: Deep testing of core algorithms (feed prioritization, network capacity, content sanitization)
7. **Performance Awareness**: Always test with realistic data volumes

### InChronicle-Specific Testing Guidelines
1. **Always test with multiple user personas**: Core connections, extended connections, non-connections
2. **Verify privacy boundaries**: Ensure workspace content doesn't leak to network view
3. **Test capacity limits**: Network limits are business-critical, must be thoroughly validated
4. **Content sanitization verification**: AI-powered sanitization must be tested with various content types
5. **Cross-workspace collaboration**: Test scenarios with users in multiple workspaces
6. **Real-time updates**: Verify feed updates, notifications, and live collaboration features

### Documentation Standards
- Maintain updated test cases with business context
- Document known issues and workarounds
- Keep environment setup instructions current
- Track test execution results with network topology details
- Share knowledge across team members
- Document feed algorithm changes and their testing implications

## Conclusion

This comprehensive QA testing guide provides the foundation for ensuring InChronicle's quality and reliability. Regular updates to this document should reflect new features, changing requirements, and lessons learned from testing activities.
