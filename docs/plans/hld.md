### mental model

The root level we have activities coming from integration. Post that, it goes through the agent which clarifies details, then correlates and combines any of many of them into a single journal entry.

This journal entry is a draft entry. It can be published to one of the workplaces (optional). It can also be published to the network (optional). The network is like a professional network where I follow n number of people, and they follow me. Whenever I want to look out what others have done, I would go to the activity field which has n number of feed items coming from the people I follow.

Workspace is a general concept. I would have a private network. Whenever I publish a journal entry, it has to be published to the workspace, and it's a mandatory thing. I may have a collaborative workspace where, let's say, it's a back-end team. Then, if I publish that to that workspace, then it gets. I'll always publish a journal entry to one of the workspaces. 

Network is another concept which we have covered here. 

Now coming back to Story and Journal Entry, they are parallel concepts looking at different aspects of raw activities.

So Journal Entry could be a daily log, a weekly log summary, or basically grouping a few entries within the last few days and coming up with an entry.

Whereas Story is mostly outcome-based in terms of impact, in terms of achievements, in terms of a specific problem statement with respect to the end user. So that the source of that is also maybe the raw activities and in some cases it can also refer to the already created draft journal entries or even the published journal entries by the same user.
