I'd want you to understand the entire project. Once done, I'd want you to suggest me specs for phase 2 of this application where I'd want to offer this product as a SAAS to organisations where they would be able to register an org, add workspaces, invite employees to the workspaces, and manage performance of these employees. Additionally, I'd want to offer Enterprise Search on the organisation across workspaces based on journal entries and ability to connect knowledgebases (SharePoint, Confluence, etc). Feel free to suggest more features that are in context of this project and add value to orgs. Don't start implementation yet


Based on my comprehensive analysis of the InChronicle project, I now have a complete understanding of the
  current application. Here's my assessment and Phase 2 SAAS specifications:
