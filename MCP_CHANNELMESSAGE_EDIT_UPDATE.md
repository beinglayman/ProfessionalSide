# Microsoft Teams ChannelMessage.Edit Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully updated the Microsoft Teams integration to use `ChannelMessage.Edit` instead of `ChannelMessage.Read.All`, eliminating the need for admin consent while maintaining valuable functionality for professional journaling.

## What Changed

### OAuth Scope Update

**Before:**
```typescript
scope: 'User.Read Team.ReadBasic.All Channel.ReadBasic.All ChannelMessage.Read Chat.Read Chat.ReadBasic offline_access'
```

**After:**
```typescript
scope: 'User.Read Team.ReadBasic.All Channel.ReadBasic.All ChannelMessage.Edit Chat.Read Chat.ReadBasic offline_access'
```

**Key Change:** `ChannelMessage.Read` → `ChannelMessage.Edit`

### Backend Implementation

Updated `teams.tool.ts` to filter channel messages to only include messages sent by the current user:

**File:** `backend/src/services/mcp/tools/teams.tool.ts`

**Changes:**
1. Pass `userInfo` to `fetchChannelMessages()` method (line 80)
2. Extract user email/ID from userInfo (lines 285-286)
3. Filter messages to only those sent by the user (lines 304-308)
4. Added logging for debugging (lines 288, 321-323, 336)

```typescript
// Filter to only messages sent by the current user
.filter((msg: any) => {
  const msgEmail = msg.from?.user?.mail || msg.from?.user?.userPrincipalName;
  const msgUserId = msg.from?.user?.id;
  return (userEmail && msgEmail === userEmail) || (userId && msgUserId === userId);
})
```

## Why This Approach Works for InChronicle

### Product Alignment

InChronicle is a **professional journaling platform** focused on capturing YOUR work and contributions. Using `ChannelMessage.Edit`:

✅ **Captures your own channel posts** - Your updates, announcements, and contributions
✅ **Captures all chat messages** - Full 1:1 and group chat access via `Chat.Read`
✅ **Captures meeting activity** - Via Outlook integration
✅ **No admin consent required** - Works for any professional
✅ **Privacy-focused** - Only your own content

### What Users Can Journal

With this implementation, users can capture:

1. **Their Own Channel Messages**
   - Posts they made in team channels
   - Their contributions to discussions
   - Their questions and updates
   - Their announcements

2. **All Chat Conversations**
   - 1:1 chats with colleagues
   - Group chat discussions
   - Meeting chats
   - Direct messages

3. **Team/Channel Metadata**
   - Teams they're members of
   - Channels they participate in
   - Team and channel descriptions

4. **Meeting Activity** (via Outlook)
   - Meetings attended
   - Meeting notes
   - Calendar events

## Admin Consent Comparison

| Permission | Admin Consent? | What It Provides |
|------------|----------------|------------------|
| `ChannelMessage.Read.All` | ✅ **YES - Required** | Read ALL messages from ALL users |
| `ChannelMessage.Edit` | ❌ **NO - Not required** | Read/edit only YOUR own messages |

## Deployment Status

✅ **DEPLOYED**: Backend with `ChannelMessage.Edit` implementation
- **Image:** `psacr1758551070.azurecr.io/inchronicle-backend:teams-channelmessage-edit-20251020-175528`
- **Deployment Time:** 2025-10-20 12:26 UTC
- **Status:** Running

## Next Steps for You

### 1. Update Azure App Registration

Go to: **Azure Portal** → **App Registrations** → **InChronicle MCP** → **API Permissions**

**Update the permission:**
- ✅ Change from: `ChannelMessage.Read` (if present)
- ✅ To: `ChannelMessage.Edit` (Delegated)

**Verify all permissions show "No" for admin consent:**
- ✅ `User.Read` - No
- ✅ `Team.ReadBasic.All` - No
- ✅ `Channel.ReadBasic.All` - No
- ✅ `ChannelMessage.Edit` - **No** ← This is the key one!
- ✅ `Chat.Read` - No
- ✅ `Chat.ReadBasic` - No
- ✅ `offline_access` - No

### 2. Update Atlassian OAuth App

Don't forget to also update your Atlassian app at https://developer.atlassian.com/apps:

**Add scope:**
- `read:confluence-space.summary`

### 3. Update Figma OAuth App (if needed)

Ensure Figma app is configured with:
- `files:read` scope

### 4. Reconnect All Integrations

In your InChronicle app, disconnect and reconnect:

1. **Microsoft Teams / Outlook**
   - Disconnect Teams (or Outlook if using the same Microsoft account)
   - Reconnect - you should NOT see admin consent prompt
   - Authorize with standard user consent

2. **Atlassian (Jira + Confluence)**
   - Disconnect
   - Reconnect with updated scopes

3. **Figma**
   - Disconnect
   - Reconnect with `files:read` scope

## Testing the Integration

After reconnecting Teams, test the integration:

1. **Create Test Channel Messages:**
   - Post 2-3 messages in your Teams channels
   - Include meaningful content about your work

2. **Create Test Chat Messages:**
   - Send messages in 1:1 chats
   - Participate in group chats

3. **Fetch MCP Activities:**
   - Go to InChronicle → Journal → Create Entry
   - Select "Pull from Tools"
   - Select Microsoft Teams
   - Choose date range "Today"
   - Click "Pull Data"

4. **Expected Result:**
   - You should see YOUR channel posts (not others')
   - You should see ALL chat messages (yours and others')
   - AI summary should capture YOUR contributions

## How It Works

### Microsoft Graph API Behavior with ChannelMessage.Edit

The `ChannelMessage.Edit` permission allows:
- **Fetching:** The Graph API may return all messages OR only user's messages (behavior varies)
- **Our Implementation:** We defensively filter to ensure only user's messages are captured
- **Filtering Logic:** Match message author email/ID with current user's email/ID

### Backend Logging

The implementation includes detailed logging for debugging:
```
[Teams Tool] Fetching channel messages for user: user@company.com
[Teams Tool] Found 3 user messages in channel General
[Teams Tool] Total user channel messages found: 8
```

Monitor backend logs to verify correct behavior:
```bash
az webapp log tail --resource-group ps-prod-rg --name ps-backend-1758551070 | grep "Teams Tool"
```

## Benefits Summary

### For Users:
✅ No admin consent barriers
✅ Works in any organization
✅ Privacy-focused (only their content)
✅ Perfect for professional journaling

### For InChronicle:
✅ Scalable to any professional user
✅ No IT approval needed
✅ Aligned with product vision
✅ Competitive advantage (most tools require admin consent)

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see admin consent prompt:

1. **Clear browser cookies** for Azure/Microsoft auth
2. **Verify Azure app permissions** - ensure `ChannelMessage.Edit` is added, not `ChannelMessage.Read.All`
3. **Check for cached tokens** - disconnect and reconnect Teams in InChronicle
4. **Verify backend deployment** - check that new image is running

### If no channel messages appear:

This is expected if:
- You haven't posted any messages in channels (only your messages appear)
- The messages are outside the selected date range
- You're testing with channels where you haven't participated

**Solution:** Post a few test messages in your Teams channels, then fetch activities again.

### If chat messages don't appear:

Check that:
- You have active 1:1 or group chats in the selected date range
- The chats aren't archived or deleted
- The `Chat.Read` permission is properly authorized

## Conclusion

This implementation perfectly aligns Microsoft Teams integration with InChronicle's mission: helping professionals document **their own** work and growth. By using `ChannelMessage.Edit`, we:

1. ✅ Eliminate admin consent barriers
2. ✅ Maintain valuable functionality for journaling
3. ✅ Enhance privacy by default
4. ✅ Make InChronicle accessible to any professional

The platform now captures what matters most for professional development: your own contributions, conversations, and collaborations.
