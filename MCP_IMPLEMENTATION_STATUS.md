# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Implementation Status & Plan

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST ðŸš¨
**This file tracks the MCP implementation progress. Check this file at the start of every Claude session to understand current status and continue work.**

Last Updated: 2025-10-08 (Current session)
Current Progress: 25% Complete
Status: INFRASTRUCTURE FIXED - Ready for OAuth implementation

---

## Current Situation Summary

### What Happened
1. MCP implementation was started with 7 tool integrations planned (GitHub, Jira, Figma, Outlook, Confluence, Slack, Teams)
2. Hit critical blocker: tsx hot-reload incompatibility with ES module exports
3. Attempted fix with CommonJS exports failed
4. Decision made to accept development limitation (Option 1)

### Current State
- **Frontend**: UI exists with discovery experience in new entry modal
- **Backend**: Routes conditionally loaded (disabled in dev, enabled in prod)
- **Database**: Schema exists (MCPIntegration, MCPAuditLog tables)
- **Development**: Backend starts successfully with MCP disabled
- **Functionality**: Infrastructure ready - OAuth implementation needed next

### Critical Files Status
```
âœ… /src/components/new-entry/new-entry-modal.tsx - MCP discovery UI complete
âœ… /src/hooks/useMCP.ts - All hooks working
âœ… /src/services/mcp.service.ts - API service ready
âœ… /backend/src/controllers/mcp.controller.ts - ES6 exports restored
âœ… /backend/src/routes/mcp.routes.ts - ES6 imports working
âœ… /backend/src/app.ts - Conditional loading implemented
âœ… /backend/MCP_DEV_LIMITATION.md - Documentation complete
```

## Implementation Plan (Option 1 - Accept Dev Limitation)

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Stabilization âœ… COMPLETE
**Status**: 100% Complete
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-08

#### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Identified tsx hot-reload issue
- [x] Attempted CommonJS fix (failed)
- [x] Decision to accept dev limitation
- [x] Reverted mcp.controller.ts to ES6 exports
- [x] Fixed mcp.routes.ts to use ES6 imports
- [x] Added conditional route loading in app.ts
- [x] Documented development limitation with clear console messages
- [x] Backend now starts without crashing

#### Development Limitation Documentation:
- MCP routes disabled in development mode by default (tsx hot-reload issue)
- Can be enabled with `ENABLE_MCP=true` environment variable (not recommended)
- For full MCP testing, use production build: `npm run build && npm start`
- Console logs clearly indicate MCP status on startup
- Full documentation: `/backend/MCP_DEV_LIMITATION.md`
- Backend starts successfully without crashes in dev mode

## Next Steps for Claude

### If Phase 1 Not Complete:
1. Check `/backend/src/controllers/mcp.controller.ts` exports
2. Verify `/backend/src/app.ts` has conditional MCP route loading
3. Test if mock endpoints exist at `/api/v1/mcp-mock/*`
4. Continue with Phase 1 tasks

### If Phase 1 Complete:
1. Start Phase 2 - OAuth Implementation
2. Begin with GitHub (highest priority)
3. Create OAuth registration guide

### Quick Test Commands:
```bash
# Check if MCP routes work in production
NODE_ENV=production npm run build && npm start

# Test MCP endpoint (should return 404 in dev, data in prod)
curl http://localhost:3002/api/v1/mcp/integrations

# Check frontend for MCP UI
# Navigate to http://localhost:5173 > Create Entry > Step 7
```

## Known Issues & Blockers

### Resolved Issues:
1. âœ… **tsx hot-reload incompatibility** - Solved with conditional loading
2. âœ… **Module export problems** - Fixed by reverting to ES6 exports
3. âœ… **Backend crashes** - Resolved by dynamic import in app.ts

### Active Blockers:
1. **No OAuth implementation** - All providers need setup (Priority 1)
2. **No API clients** - Data fetching not implemented
3. **No data processing** - AI summarization pipeline missing

### Workarounds:
1. âœ… Production build for MCP testing documented
2. Development limitation clearly communicated to users
3. Conditional loading prevents dev mode crashes

- âœ… Phase 1 complete - Backend infrastructure stable
- ðŸŽ¯ Ready to start Phase 2 (OAuth Implementation)

### 2025-01-08
- Attempted CommonJS export fix - FAILED
- Decided on Option 1 (accept dev limitation)
- Created this tracking document
- Current blocker: Need to revert controller changes

### Previous Sessions
- Initial MCP implementation started
- Frontend UI components created
- Database schema added
- Hit tsx hot-reload blocker
- Multiple attempts to fix module exports

---

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

1. **ALWAYS** check this file first when starting work on MCP
2. **NEVER** attempt to "fix" the tsx hot-reload issue - it's a known limitation
3. **TEST** in production mode: `NODE_ENV=production npm run build`
4. **UPDATE** this document after each work session
5. **PRIORITY**: Get Phase 1 complete before moving forward

---

## Contact & Escalation

If blocked for >1 day on any issue:
1. Document the blocker in this file
2. Consider alternative approaches
3. Update timeline estimates
4. Communicate clear status to user
